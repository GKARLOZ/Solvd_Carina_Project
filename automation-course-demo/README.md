* This meticulous API testing ensures that our backend services are functioning seamlessly and that data interactions are consistent.

## 2. Web Testing with Selenium and TestNG:
 * Includes the utilization of data providers for diverse test scenarios, soft assert techniques to capture failures without halting test execution, and the creation of reusable page objects.
* This approach guarantees the reliability and functionality of web tests. 

## 3. Mobile Testing with Appium, Android Studio, and Appium Inspector:
 * Detailed testing on mobile applications, ensuring compatibility with various Android devices and versions.
* Appium Inspector for inspecting mobile app elements and guaranteeing smooth user experiences on mobile platforms.
